# SimpleCalculator
A simple calculator app that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Built for beginners to learn programming logic, input handling, and basic UI design. Clean, lightweight, and easy to understand or extend for future improvements.
#üöÄ Overview

This calculator allows users to enter two numbers and select an operation to perform. Once the operation is chosen, the program instantly displays the result. The project is implemented using simple programming concepts like conditional statements, functions, and loops, making it easy to read and understand. It can be developed in any language (C, C++, Python, or Java), and can be run either in a console or with a graphical interface.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Features

Performs basic arithmetic operations (+, ‚Äì, √ó, √∑).

Supports real-time calculations with accurate results.

Handles invalid inputs and prevents errors (e.g., division by zero).

Simple and clean user interface (CLI or GUI).

Easily customizable and extendable for advanced operations.

# üíª Technical Details

The calculator‚Äôs logic is structured into separate functions for each operation, improving readability and maintainability. The program flow typically includes:

Accepting user input for two numbers.

Asking the user to choose an operation.

Performing the operation using the appropriate function.

Displaying the result on the screen.

In graphical versions, buttons represent digits and operators, and an event handler processes user actions.

# üéØ Purpose

This project is created for educational purposes, helping beginners strengthen their understanding of programming logic, mathematical computation, and basic software design. It also provides a foundation for developing more complex applications such as scientific calculators or financial tools.

# üìù Conclusion

The Simple Calculator project demonstrates how fundamental programming concepts can be used to build functional and practical applications. It‚Äôs an excellent starting point for
